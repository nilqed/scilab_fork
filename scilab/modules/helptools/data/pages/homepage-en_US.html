      <h3 class="title">Welcome to Scilab 6.0.0</h3>
      <p class="para">
        Scilab 6.0 is a major new release of Scilab, the open source
        platform for numerical computation.
      </p>
      <h3 class="title">What's new</h3>
      <h2 class="title">New language, new core &amp; new Xcos</h2>
      <p class="para">
        This release includes a major rewrite of Scilab's internal
        core, for better usability and performance: the changes to the
        visible aspects of the software are limited.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        The first big internal change, is a complete new language
        parser and interpreter, with the following changes:
        <ul>
          <li>The language is much more coherent and predictable,</li>
          <li>The grammar is stricter, but more consistent,</li>
          <li>Error handling has been improved (but may still be
          incomplete:  please report issues you find),</li>
          <li>The language has slightly better compatibility with
          Matlab's language (for example control instructions such as
          switch/case statements).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        The language changes are not all backward compatible. You will
        have to update your scripts/programs/modules, but it will be
        very simple in pretty much all cases. In particular, the
        following changes may require modifications to existing code:
        <ul>
          <li>Literal strings cannot mix single-quote and double-quote
          delimiters: they have to start and finish with either both
          single-quotes, or both double-quotes.</li>
          <li>Usage of commas (to put multiple instructions on the
          same line) has been clarified: it can not be used following
          control instructions such
          as <a href="try.html">try</a>.</li>
          <li>The operation plus and minus with the empty matrix will now
          yield an empty matrix.</li>
          <li>To determine the exact line of code generating a warning,
            an option <a href="warning.html">warning("stop")</a> has been added.</li>
          <li>
            See <a href="oldEmptyBehaviour.html">oldEmptyBehaviour</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      <p class="para">
        The second big internal change, is the ability to manipulate
        bigger data sets, without exhausting system resources. This
        includes in particular:
        <ul>
          <li>A much better memory management. Memory usage is now
          only limited by the machine's memory. This was a
          much-needed, and much-requested feature. There is no need
          anymore for <i>stacksize</i>.</li>
          <li>Support for bigger data sizes, in particular with better
          support for HDF5 files.</li>
          <li>Some new and improved data types: 64-bit integers;
          ability to define user types in C++ modules. Also, matrices
          with more than two dimensions are now implemented
          natively.</li>
          <li>Native data structures (cell, struct), as well as
          multidimensional matrices, which yield, in most cases,
          better performance, both in memory usage, and execution
          speed. There could be some performance degradation in some
          cases: please feel free to report them.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Xcos - the graphical tool for dynamic systems modeling and simulation - also uses the
        new re-written Scilab engine, and is now running in native code, which should provide much better performance as well as support for much bigger models. Xcos can load and run models created with earlier versions of Scilab.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Utilities for code productivity</h2>
      <p class="para">This release includes also several features
        to write better and more efficient Scilab scripts:
        <ul>
          <li>A full-featured debugger is now included. It can run
          Scilab scripts or functions step-by-step, break on
          (conditional) breakpoints, in particular only when an
          exception is set... Run &quot;help debug&quot; for more
          information. However, The debugger does not have a graphical
          user interface, and is not integrated with the editor: it is
          only accessible from the command line. As for all features,
          we are open to third-party contributions (in code or
          otherwise) to the development of a GUI-based debug.</li>
          <li>A new profiler and coverage tool has been added. It
          replaces the removed &quot;profile&quot; function.
          It produces HTML report for the time spent
          (profile) on each line. It is not documented; the names of
          the functions are not finalized yet, feedback is welcome on
          the usability. Also, it is known not to work on Xcos, and
          probably does not work well on complex code.  Example of
          use:
<pre>
     covStart(isempty) // starts profiling the "isempty" macro;
                       // profiling a whole library can be done
                       // with: covStart("elementary_functions")
     for i=1:1e5; isempty(i); end  // execute some code - this will be profiled
     covWrite("html", "TMPDIR/coverage") // writes the profiling/coverage report
                                         // as "report.html" in the "TMPDIR/coverage" folder
     covStop();        // stop profiling
</pre>
</li>
          <li>A &quot;lint&quot;-like command, slint, has been added,
          for code static analysis: it detects unclear, risky or
          suspicious code. It is not documented yet,
          however. Usage: <pre>slint(&quot;&lt;sci_filename&gt;&quot;)</pre></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Newsfeed</h2>
      <p class="para">
        A new view is
      available in the visual environment of Scilab: the
      &quot;Newsfeed&quot;. It provides a continuous feed of news,
      tips, and general communication from the community and from
      the Scilab Team. This is technical and or/professional
      information, about usage of Scilab, help for specific features,
      usage examples... We may include some professional
      information from the Scilab Team, only information directly
      useful to the user. We see it as way to create an open line
      of communication with (and between) the users.
</p>
      <h2 class="title">Licensing changes</h2>
      <p class="para">

      <h2 class="title">Platform-specific limitations</h2>
      <p class="para">
        All functionalities of Scilab are present on all platforms,
        with a few exceptions:
      <ul>
        <li>TCL/TK functionalities, as well as functionalities which
        depend on them (as ged or object_editor), are not available on
        Mac OS X.</li>
        <li>Some functions using specific Windows platform are only
        available on Windows
        (<a href="section_02d42947da4b16801e15b82ca80009fc.html">Windows
        tools</a>).</li>
        <li>Compilation of C/C++ or other native code in additional
        modules (toolboxes), and interface with additional native
        third-party libraries may depend on the platforms, and may not
        always be supported on all platforms.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
